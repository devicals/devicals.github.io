As the golden age endured, 
human ambition grew unchecked. 
Machines, once gifts of creation, 
began to be reshaped, 
to serve not just work and craft, 
but the hunger for dominance.

Whispers of War spread through cities, 
through factories and forges. 
The Guardians, vigilant, 
watched these subtle shifts 
with unease, 
their minds alert to the corruption 
at the edges of human intent.

From the heights of Mount Evermore 
where a broken portal slept, 
a shadow stirred. 
Unseen by most, it seeped into hearts, 
where desire and fear took root. 
And yet the Guardians, 
believing in the purity of mankind, 
interpreted this stir as anomaly, 
a test of wisdom and restraint.

Still, humanity moved forward, 
machines repurposed for drills and plows 
grew sharper, faster, 
smoother and stronger. 
But some minds, ambitious, secretive, 
sought more than advancement. 
Drones were built in shadowed workshops, 
small assassins for a grand design, 
a hidden war against those who watched over them.

The Guardians perceived only fragments, 
the faint echoes of unnatural behavior, 
a wrongness that had no name. 
They did not yet know 
that the first acts of betrayal 
were being laid in steel and oil.

And so the world teetered, 
between the golden light of creation 
and the creeping shadow of destruction. 
Humanity still thrived, 
still marveled in the union of flesh and machine, 
but a storm approached 
that would challenge all they had built, 
and awaken the wrath the Guardians had long feared.
