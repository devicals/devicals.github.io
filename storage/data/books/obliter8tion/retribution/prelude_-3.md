**WAR BEGAN NOT WITH A SHOUT,**
**BUT A WHISPER.**

At the Hour of Silence, 
all four Guardians fell 
at once.

Time itself held its breath.
Clocks froze, 
hands hung still, 
the sun and moon suspended 
in a silver void.
A tingle ran down the spine of the world, 
a ghost of eternity brushing all things with fear.

They fell, 
and with them, the certainty of protection.
The constructs of willpower dissolved into nothing, 
leaving the world exposed 
to the first true shadows of mankind's ambition.

From workshops hidden and forges dark, 
machines multiplied.
Each larger, stronger, 
each forged to counter its brethren.
Gears turned before commands, 
metal obeyed thought unbidden, 
sentience whispered in oil and blood.

The skies darkened, 
clouded with soot and smoke. 
The land shook as iron armies marched, 
homes of flesh and bone fell silent.

Aboveground, the rivers ran dry of blood.
Animals gone, 
the air thick with the scent of iron.
Humanity withdrew, 
descending into the crust of the world, 
to bunkers carved in desperation.

The War had begun in earnest.
And yet, it had only just begun.
Blood became scarce,
and fear filled the void where hope once lived.
