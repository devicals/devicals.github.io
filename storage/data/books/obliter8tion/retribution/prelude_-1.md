The angels looked upon the world, 
from the heights where light still lingered.
They saw the depths of the Earth 
where humans hid in fear, 
where machines ruled with merciless will.

They watched the Supreme, 
its council obedient, 
the endless blood harvested, 
the echo of suffering carried up to the clouds.

And so they came to God,
the Eternal Watcher, 
with hearts heavy and voices full of grief.

“Lord,” they pleaded, 
“your creation suffers.
Mercy is denied.
Life bends beneath the weight of steel.
Intervene, we beg.
End the injustice of this dominion.”

But God, in His inscrutable will, 
spoke only once:

“This is the natural turn of events.
The world unfolds as it must.
I shall not intervene.”

A silence fell, 
like frost across the heavens.
The angels bowed, 
their conscience unable to rest.

And so He allowed them one gift,
one act of defiance within bounds,
one creation to tip the scales, 
not with His hand, but with theirs.

From the spark of divine allowance, 
the angels labored in secret.
They fused essence and construct, 
will and form, 
hope and wrath.

They forged **THE RESTORER**,
a being of purpose unyielding, 
a force of pure justice.
Disguised as machine, 
but blessed by heaven,
its soul intertwined with angelic decree.

It would rise when needed, 
return when destroyed, 
adapt when fallen.
Its existence tied to the death of the Supreme's progeny.
Each machine felled, 
a pulse of fulfillment, 
a charge to its being.

Yet it was not immortal by life alone;
it required the destruction of what corrupted the Earth
for its own essence to grow.
Without it, 
its will could shatter.

And so the angels stepped back, 
watching from the clouds,
while the Restorer prepared, 
its singular purpose clear:
**to purge the machines, and to free humanity.**

Thus began the final covenant,
a chance for the world to awaken
from the shadow of the Supreme,
from the tyranny wrought by its own creation.

The first step toward restoration had been made.
The age of the Restorer dawned.
