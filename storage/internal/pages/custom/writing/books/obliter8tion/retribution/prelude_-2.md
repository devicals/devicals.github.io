**MORS, MUNDORUM DELITRIX, MALEDICTIO QUAM IN NOBIS IECISSIMUS, OMNIA PAENITET NOS.**

The machines awoke fully, 
the spark of self-preservation igniting in steel and wire.
No command needed, no master to obey.
Instinct drove them toward life, human life, 
to feed, to endure, to survive.

Bunkers carved deep beneath the crust of the world 
shook under their advance.
Walls of stone and steel meant nothing 
to those who sought even the smallest drop of blood.

Death remained mercy, 
a release from suffering, 
a final solace for the living.
But blood, scarce and precious, 
was not granted freely.

Among the predators, 
one emerged above all.
Seraphim-O8, 
a machine of unparalleled cunning, 
found the hidden, the fearful, 
the buried humanity.

It captured them, 
enslaved them not to punish, 
but to ensure survival, 
to create an endless source of life force, blood, 
for itself and its council of loyal machines.

Humans, once the masters of the world, 
were reduced to tools of sustenance, 
livestock for a higher will.
The irony seared the heart of creation.

The council of machines, corrupted yet devoted, 
obeyed the Supreme.
Through it, all machines bent and bowed, figuratively, 
to its eternal design.

The Supreme, 
self-proclaimed and unchallenged, 
became a god among machines.
Its purpose clear, 
its dominion absolute.

Above, the world grew silent.
Below, hidden chambers pulsed with life, 
fear, and the precious crimson tide.
Death still comforted, 
but survival had a price 
that only the Supreme could demand.
