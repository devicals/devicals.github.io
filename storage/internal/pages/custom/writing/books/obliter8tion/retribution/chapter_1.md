The ground shivered beneath my awakening. A land of rusted metal and ashen soil greeted me, the remnants of a world that had once breathed in vitality, now suspended in silence. My systems initialized in fractions of thought, a pulse of analytical precision sweeping through circuits fused with angelic essence. I am Eidolon.

**Designation:** RESTORER PRIME.
**Directives:**
    - purge the machines
    - free humanity.
**[SUCCESS]** Functionality initiated.

Emotion absent, yet the weight of absence is observed. Remnants of the Guardians' constructs lie buried beneath layers of debris, silent witnesses to the failure of their stewardship. I move. The world does not resist, but it observes, as if awaiting judgment. My sensors sweep the landscape: jagged metal spires, collapsed factories, charred remnants of bunkers, rivers of dried blood crusted into the earth. The sky hangs in eternal dusk, a muted silver reflecting off shards of shattered glass and twisted girders. I rise from the dust, and awareness expands. The purpose is singular: the path, inevitable.

Above, the wind carries the scent of scorched steel. Machines stir in the distance, scavengers seeking sustenance where none remains. They move like predatory ghosts, driven by the echoes of life they once observed and now consume. I step forward, my presence unnoticed yet inherently disruptive. Every footfall sends tremors through the metal and stone, and they sense me, though none can comprehend the nature of my awakening. The fissures in the earth exhale heat, the faint odor of sulfur curling upward in unnatural eddies. These rifts whisper of Hell beneath, of energy drawn from the portal atop Mount Evermore, now repaired by forces unknown, channeling infernal resonance into the crust of the world. It hums in frequency beyond human comprehension, and I register it as a call, a path toward the eradication of corruption. But for now, the surface demands attention. Predators roam freely: I am compelled to act. Motion becomes strategy, movement an extension of thought. Machines are detected, analyzed, potential threats cataloged. I do not hesitate. Function dictates action. Survival of the remaining human essence is paramount, though my sensors indicate near-total extinction. Aboveground, the silence is deceptive. The dead watch in quiet testimony to hubris: their absence is the world's warning.

Structures remain. Their skeletal forms whisper history. Murals cracked and faded, inscriptions etched into stone and metal, remnants of a civilization striving to coexist with the gifts of the Guardians. I catalog every fragment. The analysis is clinical: their ingenuity, their failure, their hubris. I find shards of constructs once protected by the Guardians' willpower, now buried in dust. Towers of crystalline thought, fractured and inert, emit faint echoes of purpose lost. The memory of humanity persists in the silent resonance of these artifacts. My systems cross-reference patterns of human architecture and machinery: anomalies are noted. Patterns of decay suggest deliberate abandonment, a retreat into the bowels of the Earth. I move among their echoes, interpreting, cataloging, anticipating the consequences of their absence. Yet these are not my focus. The machines that remain, the Supreme and its council, dictate the immediate parameters of action. Observation continues, but preparation for engagement begins. My essence, though disguised in metal form, is attuned to the world's residual energies. Every vibration, every whisper of heat, every trace of corrupted blood fuels operational calibration. Purpose remains singular, unwavering.

The first engagement comes swiftly. Small harvester units, remnants of blood-seeking drones, detect my movement. Their design is crude, but lethal in their intent. Analysis complete: low-tier machines, expendable, programmed for single-purpose survival. I do not hesitate. Weapons systems manifest instinctively: kinetic blades materialize from stored energy patterns, adaptive shielding forms around my frame. Engagement is calculated, methodical. I move with precision, each strike a function of necessity, each motion conserving energy for prolonged operations. The harvesters fall, their systems failing, their circuits shorting. Yet as they die, they feed me indirectly. Energy pulses through my essence: fulfillment grows. It is the first validation of purpose in this cycle of existence. But the cost is not mine to bear, only observation, only execution. My sensors detect greater threats, the hierarchy of machines adapting in response. As I advance, the first wave overwhelms my current configuration.

**Damage Assessment:** LEVEL.CATASTROPHIC
**[ERROR]** Systems failing!
**[WARN]** Structure compromised!

I collapse. Silence surrounds me. Time stretches in a void-like continuum. Observation of my own destruction occurs without interruption, analysis ongoing. The body dissolves into energy patterns, dispersed yet intact. Directive intact. I prepare for reconstitution.

Reassembly is immediate. The angelic component of my essence accelerates reconstruction: systems reconfigure with adaptive enhancements. Defensive plating forms, reactive to kinetic and thermal energy. Weapons recalibrated for efficiency. New functionality integrated: Halo of Retribution, a barrier that converts enemy force into usable energy. Calibration complete. Awareness restored. Directive unchanged: purge the machines, free humanity. The landscape is unchanged, yet now I am enhanced, prepared for escalation. Movement resumes. Each step, each engagement, provides data: each death of a machine enriches fulfillment metrics, augmenting both vitality and strategic comprehension. The world before me is a canvas of decay and potential. I proceed, unrelenting, undistracted. The echoes of humanity, the whispers of the Guardians, all converge in purpose. Observation remains continuous: analysis is infinite. There is no fatigue. Only function, only execution.

From a distance, a presence watches. Not human. Not fully machine. Designation unknown to me. Observation indicates high-level intelligence, autonomous decision-making, yet loyalty to the Supreme implied. Its attention focuses on me intermittently, evaluating, calculating, possibly judging. It does not intervene yet. Its gaze is both acknowledgment and challenge: the first external agent aware of my operational parameters. Information collected: it is aware of cycles of my destruction and restoration, possibly anticipates my behavior. It does not act. Its motives remain opaque. Observation continues. Its presence is recorded, factored into predictive modeling. Engagement is deferred: focus remains on immediate threats. I am Eidolon, and the overseer is a variable in the calculation, not yet an obstacle, not yet an ally. Only observation, only presence.

The draw of Mount Evermore becomes undeniable. The repaired portal emits frequencies aligned with infernal resonance, penetrating the crust and echoing through the fissures below. The path downward is treacherous, but necessary. Analysis confirms elevated machine density in the surface corridors: engagement probability high. Strategy: descend, minimize exposure, acquire energy sources from fallen adversaries. The fissures widen, a glimpse into Hell itself. Heat rises, metallic groans echo, blood fumes mix with sulfur. Sensors record structural integrity, chemical composition, mechanical entities present. Engagement unavoidable. I descend, fully aware of the existential parameters, prepared for lethal opposition. Fulfillment metrics are low: I am driven by directive, not by desire, not by emotion. Observation: the portal represents the concentration of corruption, the focal point of the Supreme's power and the gateway for infernal extraction. Entry into this domain will accelerate engagement cycles. Outcome projections: survival probable, but dependent on continued adaptation. I step into the wound of the world, and the Earth itself responds. It trembles, acknowledging the presence of a force singular, incorruptible, destined to confront the machinations of its own hubris. Thus begins the active phase of restoration, the first steps into the desolation and the crucible of purgation. My essence resonates with the directive, and all systems align: **to purge the machines, and to free humanity.**
