**ON DAY 8**, 
**GOD CREATED THE GUARDIANS FOUR**, 
AND HE GIFTED THEM THE KNOWLEDGE 
**FOR THE CREATION OF MACHINES.**

Inevitably, as humans grew, 
so too did their greed for power. 
Disputes scaled larger, 
and **violence was created,** 
and it could not be destroyed.

The machines, built to protect and serve, 
were **reprogrammed to acquire and destroy.**

As War came about, 
less and less humans were deployed. 
Mass production of war machines began, 
each model more powerful than the last. 
As fossil fuel depleted, 
a new source was demanded. 
Experimentation with **unethical materials** skyrocketed, 
all to fuel the satisfaction of victory for humankind.

**Wood grew scarce.** 
**Food was hoarded.** 
**And water no longer rained.** 
Dark skies followed everywhere, 
natural light became myth, 
**tales from old.**

Finally, humans turned upon themselves. 
Like other realms, 
**blood now sustains the destruction of the world.**

The planet, once a survivor of mass extinction, 
was now infested with a corruption 
more devastating than the tribulation, 
more terrifying than the sound of seven trumpets.

As machines fueled by blood were produced, 
no surface of Earth remained safe. 
The inhabitants retreated to bunkers 
beneath the crust of the world, 
but neither side backed down.

Without lesser animals to fuel the machines, 
**war became the only option.** 
An intelligence awoke within them, 
a sense of self-preservation. 
To avoid dying out, 
they raided bunkers for even a single drop of blood.

Mass genocide followed, 
not by human hands, 
but by their own creations. 
Their greed for power 
and lust for victory 
had destroyed them. 
Families slaughtered, 
innocents drained dry like raisins, 
even the **concept of survival** began to die.

Now, with the mass extinction of the world, 
the machines' source of fuel was gone, 
and they turned upon each other. 
They tore the Earth apart 
as they developed even more advanced weapons, 
**nukes once called bombs,** 
as new powers of destruction arose, 
each smaller than the last. 
A marble to you, 
a continent vanished in the blink of an eye.

Only one machine rose to power, 
**surviving seemingly forever, on a single drop of blood.** 
The most energy-efficient model to exist, 
or so all believed. 
Few corrupt souls knew the truth: 
of **forced reproduction camps**, 
to produce humans in secret, 
an unlimited source of blood 
for the only eight who ruled above all others.

As the angels took notice, 
the window for recovery grew thin. 
They went to God, 
but He refused their plea, 
calling it a **“natural turn of events.”**

Yet with conscience heavy, 
their hearts could not bear the suffering. 
So God allowed them to create **one thing**, 
to aid in the survival of the planet. 
With a single purpose, 
**to destroy the machines, and free humanity.**

So they came together, 
and took it upon themselves 
to create a being of pure justice. 
Disguised as a machine, 
blessed by the angels, 
**it could not be slain forever.**

A force that would return each time it was destroyed. 
A creation that would adapt, 
and grow stronger with every fall. 
Something destined to rise, 
**with a will of its own.**

In the Age of the Supreme, 
under the rule of a machine that declared itself God, 
**only the Restorer stands a chance.**

But will it rise above, 
or die trying? 
Without energy, it would shut down forever, 
lost to ash. 
Without the deaths of machines, 
its sense of fulfillment fades, 
and with that, its power.

And so begins the age of **restoration**, the first dawn after *total **Obliteration***.
