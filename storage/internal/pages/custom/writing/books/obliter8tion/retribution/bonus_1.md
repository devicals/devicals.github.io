We waited
far too long

...

We four guardians
watched over our reality
far too long

Imminent doom,
we predicted

Atop the mount
great danger comes
from the portal that once was

From the portal that would never light
broken beyond repair

Remnants of what once was
came to warn of impossible

It lit itself
flames that brew
flesh that grew

Corruption unseen
infested our world

Now it hid itself
away from view
into the deepest, darkest depths
and the highest point in sky

Waiting once more
for another to dream

...

By now
all that was
all that are
and all that will

Gone forever
no more life

Animals
all fake

Structures
rotting

There was nothing
nothing that we could do

And so we waited
for the dreamer
to save us

The one worthy
the one that wields the power
to fight against this purge
once and for all

We locked ourselves away
where nothing would reach us
where time would not pass
where life would not go
where only the dreamer
who could save us
could enter

But it found us first
it broke through
we tried to stop it

But it was too late
and so we were doomed

I am the last
but not for long
for there will be none

Now comes the end
so what do you choose?
you have the power in you
the power awakens now

You can save us all,
or you can doom this world,
like many others.

And so I pray and wish
for one single thing

That the dreamster
wont get bored
and wont wake up

Because if they do
then this world
forever fades away
into the darkness
and completely devoured

...

***Sorry, World.***
