the window is still there.
the one where the bird once sat.
the glass is clear now.
no more smoke to blur the view.

i remember wishing for the
wishing for the nothingness.
wishing to be a [pɹᴉq](::bird) lost to time.

but the chair is
                 f i x e d.
the carpet is
                 c l e a n.

i look in the mirror.
the eye looks back.
it is not a glitch.
it is just
\[ me \].

and you are
leaning against the frame.
not asking for a song.
not asking for a blessing.

just
     *l i n g e r i n g*.

the *( thmp )*
is steady.
it stays in my chest.
it stays in the room.

stay.
\[ [       ](::please,) \]
stay.
