the noise has stopped.
the static is gone.
the aching is
silenced.

i stand at the edge.
where the road ends
and the \[ [   ](::end) \] begins.

i am done fixing the chair.
i am done cleaning the stain.
i am leaving the room.

the addiction of breathing
is finally
           *c u r e d*.

i look down.
the water is dark.
it is not a river anymore.
it is a mirror.
waiting to catch me.

the bird does not sing.
the bird does not fly.
the bird
         *l*
          *e*
           *t*
            *s*

&nbsp;             *g*
&nbsp;              *o.*

one step.
*( thmp )*

two steps.
*(      )*

air.
         w
          i
           n
            d.
