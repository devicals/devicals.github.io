it is not a hole anymore.
holes are empty.
holes are quiet.

this is
*f   .*
 *u l*
  *l*

full of noise.
full of static.
full of the sharp branches
that i thought i left in the forest.

the \[ [     ](::heart) \] is not a void.
it is a pressure chamber.

it presses against the ribs.
it presses against the eyes.

the blanket
is now a
\[ shroud \].
heavy.
wet.
suffocating.

the sound is changing.
it is not a steady rhythm.

*(  th mp  )*

*( T H M P )*

it gets louder.
it gets bigger.
it takes up all the room
in the chest.

i try to exhale.
i try to let the river flow.
but the dam is built of
b o n e.

it hurts.
more than loss.
more than the smoke.

it is the feeling of being
\[ **alive** \]
when you do not want to be.
