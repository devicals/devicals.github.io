Still.              Quiet.
Nothing moved.      Nothing sounded.
Just a drip,
           *( thmp )*
                  and plop,
                          *( thmp )*
                                 as it fell to the ground.

A new coat of paint. A vibrance that stains my carpet.
Staining my table, the silver platter I put it on.

That night I gave my \[ [     ](::heart) \] to you on a silver platter.
Now the moon is hollowed.

My chest, a          \[ **pain**  \] I cannot describe.
If you came back,    \[ [ ](::I)     \] would only hurt more.

I sit
there.
Like nothing
happened.
Listen
as the salt water
drops                *( thmp )*
alongside it.

I sit there.
With a hole in my chest.
Hoping it was but a bad dream.
And I would soon hear the annoying ring,
Of the alarm next to your bed.

*( thmp )*
