It has no weight, yet I am crushed.
It has no voice, yet it is all I hear.
A guest that walked in without knocking,
And decided to replace the furniture.

It is the static on a dead channel.
The white noise that burns the ears.
A sharp, cold glass splinter
Lodged in the softest part of my marrow.

It is a debt I never signed for.
A tax collected in the hollow of my chest.
I try to cough it out,
But it is as deep as my own breath.

It is the white heat.
The feeling of pins and needles,
But the needles are made of ice.
And they never,
Ever,
Stop.

It sits in my favorite chair.
It wears my clothes.
It drinks my coffee.
It is the \[ [  ](::me) \] that I have learned to call a "friend."

I look in the mirror to see my face,
But behind my eyes,
There is only
[    ](::pain).
