it started as a spark

no, not a fire.
not like the chimney.
not the smoke that chokes the room.

it is a slow crawl.
a golden syrup that
                    *f   s*
                     *i l*
                      *l*
the cracks where the salt water dried.

my chest,
no longer a hole.
it feels like a heavy blanket.
a weight that doesn't crush,
but keeps the frost from settling.

i am
     *ex p  a   n    d     i      n       g*.

the *( thmp )*
is no longer a thud on the floor.
it is a hum in the marrow.

it is the sun
              reaching
                       through
                               the dust.
it is the feeling of
being *k n o w n*.
