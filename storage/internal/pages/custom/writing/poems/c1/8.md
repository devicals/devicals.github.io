the river dried up today.
the salt returned to the cracks.
the smoke is back in the room.

i thought i fixed the chair.
i thought i cleaned the carpet.
but the stain is
visible.

it is a circle.
a wheel that turns
and turns
and turns.

the chest is heavy again.
or maybe it is light.
it is hard to tell the difference
between a weight
and a
\[ [       ](::feather) \].

the bird is at the window.
but it does not sing.
it does not look at me.
it just watches.

i wake up.
i breathe.
i sit.

...
*( thmp )*

and i go.
