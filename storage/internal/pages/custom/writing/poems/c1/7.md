the salt water didn't dry.
it didn't stay in the cracks.
it broke the dam.

it is no longer a drip.
it is no longer a
                  *( thmp )*
plop.

it is a
        *st*
          *re*
            *am*
flowing through the
\[ [    ](::hole) \]
where the heart used to be.

it washes the silver platter.
it carries the feathers of the drib
out of the sharp forest
and into the *o p e n*.

i am not
\[ drowning \].
i am the
         c

             .

it carries the smoke away.
it carries the *( thud )* away.

let it
       fl
         o
          w.

the eye in the mirror
is blurred by the waves.
and for once,
i don't mind the
[    ](::pain).
