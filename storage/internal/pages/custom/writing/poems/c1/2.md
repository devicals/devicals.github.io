I woke up today.
My eyes opened to a room of smoke.

I left the fire on yesterday.
My fire burnt out already.

I woke up today.
It's like an addiction.
Something I can't drop,
like breathing.

A bad habit that was born with me.
Everyone else thinks it's normal.
It is normal.

I wish I could stop.
Like giving up drugs.
I wish I could stop.
I wish I could go to sleep.
I wish the next morning, I wouldn't wake up.
Keep myself in a dream.
A dream that never ends.
But when it will end, I wouldn't even know it.

I woke up today.
My ears hear the birds outside chirping.

I woke up today.
My nose smelling the nature that breathed in.

I woke up today.
It's like an addiction.

I breathed today.
*Inhale*,            *exhale*.
I didn't even know it.
My chest, *up*       and *down*.
I wish I would stop relying on oxygen.

I wish I could go to sleep.
Keep dreaming.
Stay dreaming.
Live dreaming.
Die dreaming.
Dream that I won't have to leave my bed.
Dream that I wouldn't have to face reality tomorrow.
Dream that tomorrow would never come.
Dream that I wouldn't wake up.
Dream that everyone would just forget me.

Dream that I,
would forget me.
