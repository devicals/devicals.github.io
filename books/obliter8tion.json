        "content": "**ON DAY 8**, \n**GOD CREATED THE GUARDIANS FOUR**, \nAND HE GIFTED THEM THE KNOWLEDGE \n**FOR THE CREATION OF MACHINES.**\n\nInevitably, as humans grew, \nso too did their greed for power. \nDisputes scaled larger, \nand **violence was created —** \nand it could not be destroyed.\n\nThe machines, built to protect and serve, \nwere **reprogrammed to acquire and destroy.**\n\nAs War came about, \nless and less humans were deployed. \nMass production of war machines began — \neach model more powerful than the last. \nAs fossil fuel depleted, \na new source was demanded. \nExperimentation with **unethical materials** skyrocketed, \nall to fuel the satisfaction of victory for humankind.\n\n**Wood grew scarce.** \n**Food was hoarded.** \n**And water no longer rained.** \nDark skies followed everywhere, \nnatural light became myth — \n**tales from old.**\n\nFinally, humans turned upon themselves. \nLike other realms, \n**blood now sustains the destruction of the world.**\n\nThe planet, once a survivor of mass extinction, \nwas now infested with a corruption \nmore devastating than the tribulation, \nmore terrifying than the sound of seven trumpets.\n\nAs machines fueled by blood were produced, \nno surface of Earth remained safe. \nThe inhabitants retreated to bunkers \nbeneath the crust of the world, \nbut neither side backed down.\n\nWithout lesser animals to fuel the machines, \n**war became the only option.** \nAn intelligence awoke within them — \na sense of self-preservation. \nTo avoid dying out, \nthey raided bunkers for even a single drop of blood.\n\nMass genocide followed, \nnot by human hands, \nbut by their own creations. \nTheir greed for power \nand lust for victory \nhad destroyed them. \nFamilies slaughtered, \ninnocents drained dry like raisins — \neven the **concept of survival** began to die.\n\nNow, with the mass extinction of the world, \nthe machines' source of fuel was gone, \nand they turned upon each other. \nThey tore the Earth apart \nas they developed even more advanced weapons — \n**nukes once called bombs,** \nas new powers of destruction arose, \neach smaller than the last. \nA marble to you — \na continent vanished in the blink of an eye.\n\nOnly one machine rose to power — \n**surviving seemingly forever, on a single drop of blood.** \nThe most energy-efficient model to exist — \nor so all believed. \nFew corrupt souls knew the truth: \nof **forced reproduction camps**, \nto produce humans in secret — \nan unlimited source of blood \nfor the only eight who ruled above all others.\n\nAs the angels took notice, \nthe window for recovery grew thin. \nThey went to God, \nbut He refused their plea — \ncalling it a **“natural turn of events.”**\n\nYet with conscience heavy, \ntheir hearts could not bear the suffering. \nSo God allowed them to create **one thing**, \nto aid in the survival of the planet. \nWith a single purpose — \n**to destroy the machines, and free humanity.**\n\nSo they came together, \nand took it upon themselves \nto create a being of pure justice. \nDisguised as a machine, \nblessed by the angels, \n**it could not be slain forever.**\n\nA force that would return each time it was destroyed. \nA creation that would adapt, \nand grow stronger with every fall. \nSomething destined to rise — \n**with a will of its own.**\n\nIn the Age of the Supreme — \nunder the rule of a machine that declared itself God — \n**only the Restorer stands a chance.**\n\nBut will it rise above, \nor die trying? \nWithout energy, it would shut down forever, \nlost to ash. \nWithout the deaths of machines, \nits sense of fulfillment fades — \nand with that, its power.\n\n---\n\nAnd so begins the age of **restoration** — the first dawn after *total **Obliteration***."
