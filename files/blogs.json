        "content": "Hope ya'll had a wonderful Spooktober and Halloween! Anyways just a little more changes, the Projects tab now has a separate tab bar instead of having whole sections for the three project group thingies. You can use **#projects?tab={ID}** to link directly to any tab! As usually the ID will be displayed next to the name of each section.\nAnother change is to the book rendering! Now although it uses a bit more definition (**.json**) files, it makes my life EVEN EASIER because now all the chapters will be using **.md**, so it **1)** makes it easier for me to look at and **2)** I no longer have to replace all the line breaks with **&#92;n**. I won't be applying this system to the blogs because I'm not gonna make blogs THAT long, and I'm just lazy. Anyways, CYA!"

        "content": "It's the 31st, and you know what that means! Happy All Hallows' Eve everyone! A few changes occured:\n\n**1.** I merged the blogs page back into index.html, providing a smoother experience with the tab bar.\n**2.** Projects have been moved to the now Projects tab, and it has multiple sections, currently: Coding Projects, Books, and Minecraft.\n**3.** I have added back the fuctionality of using # to define where you want to be! Now you can add **#about**, **#blog**, or **#projects** at the end of the link to be on the Profile, Blog, or Projects tab respectively. Furthermore, blogs now had a numerical ID, displayed next to the date. With **#blog?id={ID}** where **{ID}** is the ID of the blog post, you can directly open to page to that post!\n**4.** Now practically everything are now defined using JSON, e.g. the blog posts, projects, even the books! This makes my life SO much easier making these posts and stuff, and makes my code just that tad bit cleaner and shorter! Hopefully because of this, I'll be making more blog posts now!\n**5.** As a Halloween special, I'm making a 3 chapter short psychological horror story that may release in a few weeks.\n**6.** Also, I've added back the [RSS feed](index.html#blog?id=8) feature!\n\nAnyways, that's all for now, have a very happy Halloween guys!"

To de-clutter my index.html I also split off the blog into a separate page of its own, but of course as you probably have seen, still easily accessible via the tab-bar at the top of the page. Also check out my new book (*still in WIP*) [here](obliter8tion.html)."

You should check them all out! I also did some shenanigans and now the projects in Infiniverse also appear on my user profile, so you can check it all out at [https://modrinth.com/user/error_dev_yt](https://modrinth.com/user/error_dev_yt)!"

Not to mention I've allowed you all to choose your own theme by cycling through some premade themes!

Okay, listen up.\n\n**Change #1:**\nI added a projects section that lists a few of my projects.\n\n**Change #2:**\nInstead of the jump-to feature for the blog page, I added a table of contents at the very top of the blog page, so you can quickly jump to whichever blog post you want, in seconds. You may have also seen that I changed the layout a bit, with each post having buttons that let you go to the very top, the last post, or the next post.\n\n**Change #3:**\nBranding. Now, the DEV.() branding still exists, but the website has an additional branding, *\"Wormhole of Error Dev\"*. Also you may have noticed the color scheme changed. Now it's orange and purple.\n\n-------\n\n**Update:**\nSo you guys remember the last update, on the 13th right? Yeah well Neocities support FINALLY came back to me, and told me that they found the error and fixed it, so now I've got access to the site again. This is absolutely **BRILLIANT NEWS.** However, I'm still going to stick with Github, because I'm afraid something like that will happen again, and this time I'm making sure to make local backups all the time. I'm probably going to use the neocities site, for something different."

I'll let you explore that on your own.\n\nNow onto the features!\n\nFirst of all, I added a contact me form on the main page, so you guys can send me emails from this very website! I also added a newsletter feed under it, you just plop your email there and BOOM!, you're subscribed!\n\nSecondly, the blog post \"jump to tags\" function has also been changed. As you can see above the big blog titles, there's a small line of text that contains the blog number and the blog date. The jump to tags now function using the blog number. The format is **#blog<#>** with **<#>** being the blog number. For example, to automatically jump to this blog post, you would go to **https://3rror-dev.github.io/blogs#blog9**, note the main part: **#blog9**. Also, to view the latest blog post, you can now go to the tag **#blog0**!\n\nAlright, that's it for now, see y'all! (It has since been revamped again, twice!)"
